# Create your own Lab

Learn how to create your own labs for the **Emio Labs** application.

## Introduction
The content of the **Emio Labs** application can be easily adjusted or completely changed. By following this documentation you’ll be able to modify the labs and create your own content.

A lab is written as a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file (with the `.md` extension) that should be located in the directory `assets/labs/LAB_DIR_NAME`. Navigate through the directories in `assets/labs`. Each directory has a `.md` file which can be loaded and displayed by the application. The directories also usually contain a `.py` file, implementing a simulation scene for SOFA. This simulation will typically be launched when clicking the :sofaicon: button in the exercise sections of the lab. These directories might also contain extra files needed for the lab, like parameters file or python scripts.

## Compose your own Set of Labs

<figcaption>The main dashboard of the Emio Labs application shows the labs content of the application.</figcaption>

The content of the application is set in the file `assets/labs/labsConfig.json`. If you want to add or remove some labs simply modify this file. You'll need to provide:

- the **name** of the directory containing your `.md` **file
- the **filename** (if different than the directory name)
- a **title** and **description** to display in the main dashboard

The order of the labs in the application will match the order in the `labsConfig.json` file. For example:   

```json
{
    "labs": [
        {
            "name": "introduction",
            "title": "Introduction",
            "description": "discover Emio and its software GUI"
        },
        {
            "name": "lab_models",
            "filename": "lab_models.md",
            "title": "Lab 1. Models",
            "description": "discover and analyse different models"
        },
        {
            "name": "sandbox",
            "filename": "sandbox.md",
            "title": "Sandbox",
            "description": "set up Emio exactly how you want"
        }]
}
```

## Write your own Lab in Markdown

You can always refer to the `README.md` file of the `assets/labs` directory for the Markdown cheat sheet. It provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements and the ones developed for this application which we presents now.

### Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

| **Element** | **Markdown Syntax** |
| --- | --- |
| Heading | # H1<br/> ## H2<br/> ### H3 |
| Bold | \*\*bold text\*\* |
| Italic | \*italicized text\* |
| Block-quote | > block-quote |
| Ordered List | 1. First item <br/> 2. Second item <br/>3. Third item |
| Unordered List | - First item<br/>- Second item<br/>- Third item |
| Code | \`code\`<br/> \`\`\`languageblock<br/>code<br/>\`\`\` |
| Horizontal Rule | ```---``` |
| Link | ```[title](https://www.example.com)``` |
| Image | ```![alt text](image.jpg)``` |

### **Extended Syntax**

These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. It will only be understood by this application. We use nested fenced block principle to define our custom blocks. A block fence is a sequence of at least three consecutive `:`. The content of the fenced block consists of all subsequent lines, until a closing block fence with at least as many `:` as the opening block fence.

If you want to nest multiple fenced blocks, the parent block fence should have more `:` than the children. For example :

```markdown
:::: parent
::: child
MY_CONTENT
::: // end of child
:::: // end of parent
```

#### **Quiz**

You can create a quiz with **open answer** or a **multiple choice question**. For an open answer, create a block fence with the keyword `quiz`. Inside the quiz fence block, create another block fence with the keyword `question`, followed by your question (on the same line) and the answer on the next line, inside the block fence. For example : 

```markdown
:::: quiz 
::: question What are the advantages of using beam models, compared to volume models? 
Beam models simplify calculations compared to full three-dimensional models, reducing computation time and resources needed. They are widely used in many civil and mechanical engineering applications, facilitating the analysis and design of structures such as bridges and buildings. In our case, beam models are well-suited to predict the behavior of a continuum robot, especially when the model is used for control purposes. 
::: 
::::
```

This will give the following :

<img className="centered" src={emio_labs_quizopen} width="70%"/>
<figcaption>Question with an open answer.</figcaption>

<img className="centered" src={emio_labs_quizopenanswer} width="70%"/>
<figcaption>After giving an answer and clicking on the `Submit` button.</figcaption>

For a question with multiple choice, create a block fence with the keyword `quiz`. Inside the quiz fence block, create another block fence with the keyword `question`, followed by your question (on the same line) and the list of possible answer the next line, inside the block fence. The good answers are set with `[X]` and the wrong answers with `[]` . For example : 

```markdown
:::: quiz 
::: question Which model is the best suited for the blue leg?
- [X] Cosserat
- [ ] Volume
- [X] Beam
:::
::::
```

This will give the following :

<img className="centered" src={emio_labs_qcm01} width="70%"/>
<figcaption>Question with multiple choice answer.</figcaption>

<img className="centered" src={emio_labs_qcm03} width="70%"/>
<figcaption>When selected the answer.</figcaption>

<img className="centered" src={emio_labs_qcm02} width="70%"/>
<figcaption>After submitting the answer.</figcaption>

#### **Video**

You can add videos by using the following container :

```markdown
#main-video("PATH_OR_URL_TO_MY_VIDEO")
#video("PATH_OR_URL_TO_MY_VIDEO")
```

The `main-video` will move to the bottom right corner of the application when scrolling down. Only one `main-video` should be used in a markdown file (lab).

#### **Highlighted block**

You can highlight some text by using the following block fence with the keyword `highlight` :

```markdown
::: highlight
MY_CONTENT
:::
```

#### **Exercise block**

You can highlight your exercises by using the following block fence with the keyword `exercise` :

```markdown
::: exercise
MY_EXERCISE_CONTENT
:::
```

#### **Collapsible block**

Create collapsible section with the following block fence with the keyword `collapse` :

```markdown
::: collapse MY_TITLE
MY_CONTENT
:::
```

#### **Select block**

Create select content with the following block fence with the keyword `collapse` :

```markdown
:::: select MY_UNIQUE_SELECT_NAME
::: option MY_OPTION_1
::: option MY_OPTION_2
::: option MY_OPTION_3
::::
```

You may have as many options as you want.

#### **Buttons**

```markdown
#runsofa-button("MY_SCENE.py", "MY_ARGUMENT_1", "MY_ARGUMENT_2")

#open-button("MY_FILE")
```

An argument can be the current value of a select block by using its unique select name, that you defined. For example:

```markdown
#runsofa-button("MY_SCENE.py", "MY_UNIQUE_SELECT_NAME", "MY_ARGUMENT_2")
```

#### **Icons**

```markdown
#icon(ICON_NAME)
```

We use the icon library [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons). For example:

```markdown
#icon(warning)
```

#### **Input**

```markdown
#input("MY_UNIQUE_INPUT_NAME", "MY_OPTIONAL_PLACEHOLDER", "MY_OPTIONAL_DEFAULT_VALUE")
```

For example:

```markdown
#input("customleg") // no placeholder and no default value
#input("customleg", "leg name") // with placeholder
#input("customleg", "leg name", "blueleg") // with placeholder and default value
#input("customleg", "", "blueleg") // no placeholder and default value
```
