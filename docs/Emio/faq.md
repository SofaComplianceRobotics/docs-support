## My Robot

### - Can I customize Emio's setup in simulation?
    
    <aside>
    
    The **emio-labs** application offers a sandbox mode that allows you to set up Emio exactly as you want, using either the original set of legs and connectors or your own designed parts. In the main dashboard, click on the Sandbox link to open the corresponding page:
    
    1. Follow the instructions to set up your Emio and its numerical twin.
    2. Launch the corresponding simulation by clicking the SOFA button as usual, and enjoy!

### - How can I change the legs on the robot ?

    Have a look at Emio’s [Hardware User Manual](https://www.notion.so/136582ce7d3a810aa99cdf5a5640ec86?pvs=21) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- Why doesn't my simulation seem to control the real robot?
    
    <aside>
    
    - Check that the physical device is properly connected and powered on. Refer to Emio's [Hardware User Manual](https://www.notion.so/136582ce7d3a810aa99cdf5a5640ec86?pvs=21) for detailed instructions.
    - Make sure only one simulation is running. Close all active simulations and restart the simulation software.
    - Check for any errors in the corresponding logs (found in the emio-labs application, beneath the SOFA button you've just clicked).
    - If you encounter an error message, consult the **emio-labs > Introduction > Let's try Emio > Troubleshooting** section.
    - Verify that you've toggled the **Simulation / Robot** button at the top of the simulation software (it should be green).

- The depth camera does not seem to work, what can I do?
    
    <aside>
    
    - Make sure only one simulation is running. Close all active simulations, unplug and plug again the USB cable, and restart the simulation software.
    - Make sure to use the provided USB cable.
    - If you have a USB hub between the computer and Emio, try first without.
    - Try to use a USB 3 port (should be blue or with a super speed mark).
    - Open a webcam application and check if the software detects the camera.
