# Getting Started with Emio

Emio is a parallel deformable robot developed by [Compliance Robotics](https://compliance-robotics.com/). 
It features a structure composed of four servo motor-actuated deformable legs connected together. 

The robot comes equipped with a depth camera and a set of accessories, including multiple deformable legs and connectors, all stored in a dedicated drawer.

Emio features two distinct configurations, as shown in the images below:

1. **Extended Configuration**: In this setup, the legs point downward, enabling it to perform tasks such as pick-and-place.
2. **Compact Configuration**: Here, the legs are oriented upward, facilitating easier interaction with the robot.

## Connecting Emio to Your Computer
You will find a USB cable in the drawer to connect the robot to your computer. The robot also has a power supply and a switch.
To connect Emio to your computer:
1. Plug the USB cable into the USB port of Emio (see Figure 2),
2. Connect the other end of the USB cable to your computer,
3. Plug the power supply into the power port of Emio (see Figure 3),
4. Turn on the switch to power the robot (see Figure 3).

## Attaching Legs to Motors
Each motor is equipped with a drum and a cap for connecting a leg.

To attach a leg to a motor:
    1. Find the zero position of the motor is indicated by the orange marker pointing upward,
    2. Simply rotate the cap until you can set the leg into the desired orientation,
    3. Once the leg is in place, rotate the cap again to lock it.

:::note
Throughout the lab sessions, you will be instructed to configure Emio into specific setups. Simply follow the 
provided instructions by clicking on *Set up Emio*. We use colors to refer to the legs and connectors, and numbers to identify the motors.

## Calibrating The Camera
The camera calibration is required for some labs. It allows to calculate the transform from the camera image to 3D points into the Emio reference frame. The Emio API (included with Emio Labs) comes calibrated but the calibration can vary based on if the camera has been moved. 

If you notice that the markers are too far from the reality, you might need to recalibrate the camera.

### Set up Emio
You will need:

- (1) the Aruco marker 
- (2) two green markers
- (3) the blue supports to raise the platform

To set up Emio for calibration, follow these steps:
1. raise the platform using the blue supports on the beam
2. place the Aruco marker on the platform so that the small arrow points to the camera
3. place two green markers in the slots of the Aruco marker
4. plug emio to the computer and to the power supply

### Start the Calibration
Calibration can be done using several methods: with Emio Labs or with the Emio API.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs" groupId="calibration-methods">
  <TabItem value="emio-labs" label="Emio Labs" default>
       The easiest way to start the calibration is to use the SOFA Robotics interface from EmioLabs:
        1. open EmioLabs
        2. go to the `Lab Models` page
        3. select the `Camera Calibration` section
        5. run the simulation by pressing the SOFA button in the section
        6. press the _Play_ button to start the simulation
        7. toggle the robot connection button to connect to the robot
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="emio-api" label="Emio API">
    Alternatively, you can start the calibration using Emio API.
    From a terminal with a Python executable path that has emioapi installed, run:
    ```bash
    python -m emioapi calibrate
    ```
    For more information, go to the [Emio API documentation](../../../Developers/emio-api/#calibrate) and follow the instructions to start the calibration process.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Calibration Process

Regardless of the method you use to start the calibraiton, the process will start by opening several windows, including a _Calibration_ window and a _HSV_ window.

    <div>
    <img className="centered" src={calib_window}  alt="The calibration window with the aruco marker being tracked."/>

    <div>
    <img className="centered" src={calib_hsv_window}  alt="The HSV window with the result of the green markers tracking."/>

    The _HSV_ window displays the 3D position of the two markers in the frame of the camera (first line) and in the simulation frame (second line).
    </figcaption>
    </div>
</div>

The calibration ends when the _Calibration_ window closes and the _HSV_ window displays the position of the the two markers.

To make sure the calibration is successful, you can check the simulation coordinates of the markers in the HSV window:
- The top marker should  be at around `(32, -230, 32)`
- The bottom marker should be at `(-32, -230, -32)`

In the simulation, if used, the green markers (_i.e._ what the camera is tracking) should be at the same positions as the red markers (_i.e._ theoretical positions). The actual error for each marker can be seen in the _Information_ collapsible menu in the _My Robot_ window. You can expect an error of around 2-4 mm for each marker.

Once the calibration is done, you can close the SOFA window or `Ctrl+C` if you used Emio API. The saved calibration will be used for all the following use of the Emio API.
