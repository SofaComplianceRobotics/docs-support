# Getting Started with Emio

Emio is a parallel deformable robot developed by [Compliance Robotics](https://compliance-robotics.com/). 
It features a structure composed of four servo motor-actuated deformable legs connected together. 

The robot comes equipped with a depth camera and a set of accessories, including multiple deformable legs and connectors, all stored in a dedicated drawer. This modular design enables to customize Emio for specific applications.

Emio features two distinct configurations, as shown in the images below:

1. **Extended Configuration**: In this setup, the legs point downward, enabling it to perform tasks such as pick-and-place.
2. **Compact Configuration**: Here, the legs are oriented upward, facilitating easier interaction with the robot.

These configurations, combined with its deformable structure, make Emio a versatile tool for both educational and research purposes.

You will find a USB cable in the drawer to connect the robot to your computer. The robot also has a power supply and a switch. 
Each motor is equipped with a drum and a cap for connecting a leg. 
You can take a leg from the drawer and attach it to a motor. 
Simply rotate the cap until you can set the leg into the desired orientation (as shown in the images). 
The zero position of the motor is indicated by the orange marker pointing upward.

:::note
Throughout the lab sessions, you will be instructed to configure Emio into specific setups. Simply follow the 
provided instructions by clicking on *Set up Emio*. We use colors to refer to the legs and connectors, and numbers to identify the motors.
