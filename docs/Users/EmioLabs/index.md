This application is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for students and researchers interested in soft robotics.
It includes a series of interactive labs that cover various aspects of soft robotics, including modeling, inverse kinematics, pick & place, design, and closed-loop control. It is built to be used with the [Emio robot](https://compliance-robotics.com/compliance-lab/), a reconfigurable continuum parallel robot developed by Compliance Robotics.
