## Highlights

You can now download emio-labs for MacOS ! 

## Other changes
- The labs have been renamed, removing the numbering to let you organize the labs as you want
- The camera orientation in the simulation is automatically changed with respect to Emio's configuration: extended or compact  
- Changes in the solutions: 
    - The leg for the `lab_design` does not collide with the structure anymore
    - There were some typo in the solutions of the `lab_colsedloop`
- In the sandbox, you can now set up Emio with a custom number of legs
- There were some typo and descriptions missing in the `lab_inversekinematics`:
    - Matrices descriptions in the course material
    - Unifies the notation between the python code and course material
    - Detailed explanations in the solution
- You will now find tips to 3D print the soft parts of Emio in the `lab_design` 
- Update the instruction for the setup of FreeCAD in the `lab_design`
- The numbering of the motors was shifted in some labs
- Parameters fix:
    - The mass of the cube in the `lab_models` was off by a factor of 10
    - The Young's modulus has been changed consequently
    - The artificial rigidity of the FEM volume model is compensated with the `tetraYMFactor` set in the `parameters.py` file
- On Linux, you can use the option `show_video_feed` in the `DotTracker` to see the camera feed while running the simulation
