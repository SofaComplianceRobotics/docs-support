## Troubleshooting

<details>
    <summary>Why doesn't my simulation seem to control the real robot?</summary>
    <aside>
    - Check that the physical device is properly connected and powered on. Refer to Emio's [User Manual](../Emio/emio-hardware-user-manual) for detailed instructions.
    - Make sure only one simulation is running. Close all active simulations and restart the simulation software.
    - Check for any errors in the corresponding logs (found in the Emio Labs application, beneath the SOFA button you've just clicked).
    - If you encounter an error message, consult the **Emio Labs > Introduction > Let's try Emio > Troubleshooting** section.
    - Verify that you've toggled the **Simulation / Robot** button at the top of the simulation software (it should be green).

    <summary>The depth camera does not seem to work, what can I do?</summary>
    <aside>
    - Make sure only one simulation is running. Close all active simulations, unplug and plug again the USB cable, and restart the simulation software.
    - Make sure to use the provided USB cable.
    - If you have a USB hub between the computer and Emio, try first without.
    - Try to use a USB 3 port (should be blue or with a super speed mark).
    - Open a webcam application and check if the software detects the camera.
