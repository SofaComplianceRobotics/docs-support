<figcaption>The **SOFA Robotics** GUI.</figcaption>

[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework designed for interactive mechanical simulations, with a strong focus on bio-mechanics and robotics. At Compliance Robotics, we have developed a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) for SOFA, designed specifically for robotics applications allowing to control and program robots with ease.
